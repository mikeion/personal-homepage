      "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and methods from computational social science have provided new opportunities in mathematics education research, particularly in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL). Understanding students' conversations can provide insights into their learning processes, but we lack reliable methodologies to extract useful learning information from them at scale. This presentation explores the innovative use of LLMs and other text-as-data methods for analyzing large-scale conversational datasets from online mathematics learning communities. We will discuss how these generative AI models can transform our understanding student learning and engagement outside traditional classroom settings. More specifically, this presentation will provide details about a study that used LLM prompting to reliably classify over 100,000 mathematics students' questions into different question types (e.g., basic inquiry, procedural reasoning, exploratory inquiry), as these categorizations can be used to extract meaningful information about the learning processes students go through in these informal, online mathematical conversations. We will conclude by discussing how text-as-data methods can address the inherent limitations traditionally faced by educational researchers in analyzing conversational data."
