      "fullDescription": "Developing frameworks to evaluate AI-generated educational dialogues along two critical dimensions: simulation fidelity (how realistically LLMs mimic student behavior) and interaction effectiveness (whether these exchanges produce meaningful learning). This research helps distinguish between LLMs that merely \"sound like\" students versus those that facilitate genuine educational progress.",
